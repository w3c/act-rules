## Description

This rule checks that repeated blocks of content are collapsible

## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectation

For each [block of repeated content][] in each test target, which is before (in the [flat tree][]) at least one node of [non-repeated content after repeated content][], all the following are true:

- there exists an [instrument][] to make all nodes in this [block][] not [visible][]; and
- there exists an [instrument][] to remove all nodes in this [block][] from the [accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree].

## Assumptions

_No assumptions._

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

Usually the same [instrument][] removes both [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of a [block of repeated content][]. That [instrument][] may remove all [blocks of repeated content][block of repeated content]. If there is no [block of repeated content][] before the non-repeated content the rule passes.

[Technique SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28] does not have any requirements concerning the location of the [instruments][instrument] in relation to the [block of repeated content][] they control, hence this rule doesn't. It is likely a good idea to either keep each [instrument][] close to the start of the [block of repeated content][] it controls; or to group them all in one place near the start of the document. Notably, [instruments][instrument] located after (in reading order) the block they collapse are likely not satisfying [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks][sc241], which this rule is designed for. Thus, it is possible to pass this rule without satisfying [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks][sc241].

- [Technique SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content][tech scr28]

To avoid using landmarks for the non-repeated content, which would satisfy [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Block][sc241], which this rule is designed for, this rule uses `<div id="main">` in its test cases to indicate where non-repeating content exists. It is recommended to use the `main` landmark instead. The `aside` and `nav` elements are each a [block of repeated content][] due to the link inside the `nav` element to a page with similar [blocks of content][block of content].

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

This document has a link at the start of the document to toggle the [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of the navigational [block of repeated content][].

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>

				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

This document has a button at the start of the document to toggle the [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of both the complementary and the navigational [blocks of repeated content][block of repeated content].

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>

			</ol>
		</nav>

		<aside id="about-book">
			<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
		</aside>

		<div id="main">
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

This document has two dedicated [instruments][instrument] to toggle the [visibility][visible] and [inclusion in the accessibility tree][included in the accessibility tree] of the complementary and the navigational [blocks of repeated content][block of repeated content] respectively.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/toggle-display.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>

	<body>
		<a href="#" onclick="toggleHidden('chapters-navigation')">Toggle table of content</a>
		<button onclick="toggleHidden('about-book')">Toggle extra content</button>

		<nav id="chapters-navigation">
			<ol>

				<li><a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter2.html">Chapter 2</a></li>
			</ol>
