Accessibility Requirements Mapping:
:   [2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels)
    - **Required for conformance** to WCAG 2.0 and later on level AA and higher
    - [Outcome](#outcome) mapping:
        - Any `failed` outcomes: success criterion is not satisfied
        - All `passed` outcomes: success criterion needs further testing
        - An `inapplicable` outcome: success criterion needs further testing

Input Aspects:
:   [Accessibility Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-accessibility)
:   [DOM Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-dom)
:   [CSS Styling](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-css)
:   [Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-aspects/#input-aspects-text)

## Description

This rule checks that headings describe the topic or purpose of the content.

## Applicability

This rule applies to any element with the [semantic role][] of heading that is either [visible][] or [included in the accessibility tree][].

## Expectation 1

Each target element which is [visible][] describes the topic or purpose of the first [palpable content][] which is non-[decorative][], [visible][], and after the target in tree order in the [flat tree][].

## Expectation 2

Each target element which is [included in the accessibility tree][] describes the topic or purpose of the first [palpable content][] which is non-[decorative][], [included in the accessibility tree][], and after the target in tree order in the [flat tree][].

**Note:** Headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character, may suffice.

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.
- This rule assumes that the [flat tree][] order is close to the reading order, as elements are rendered on the page. Due to positioning, it is possible to render a document in a order that greatly differ from the tree order, in which case the content which is visually associated with a heading might not be the content following it in tree order and this rule might fail while [Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Label][sc246] is still satisfied.

## Accessibility Support

Implementation of [Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution][] varies from one browser or assistive technology to another. Depending on this, some elements can have a [semantic role][] of `heading` and fail this rule with some technology but users of other technologies would not experience any accessibility issue.

## Background

- [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.6: Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html)
- [G130: Providing descriptive headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130)
- [H42: Using h1-h6 to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H42)
- [ARIA12: Using role=heading to identify headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA12)
- [HTML Specification - Heading content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#heading-content)
