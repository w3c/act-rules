### Most Common Language of an Element {#most-common-element-language}

The _most common language of an element_ is determined by counting the number of _words_ in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from this element that are part of any of the languages in the [language subtag registry][]. The same word can be part of multiple languages. In case of ties, the element has several most common languages. If there are no words in the [text inheriting its programmatic language][] from the element, then it has no most common language.

For more details, see [examples of most common language](/pages/examples/element-language/).
