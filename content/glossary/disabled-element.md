### Disabled Element {#disabled-element}

An element is _disabled_ when it has been rendered [inoperable][] in one of the following ways:

1. The element matches the [`:disabled` pseudo-class][disabled pseudo-class]. For HTML elements this means that the element is [actually disabled][].

2. The element has a [shadow-including ancestor][] whose `aria-disabled` [attribute value][] is "true".
