### Block of content {#block-of-content}

A _block of content_ in an [HTML web page][] is a set of nodes from that page for which all the following are true:

- **content**: there is at least one node which is [perceivable content][] in the block; and
- **continuity**: if two nodes are in the block, then any node between them (in tree order) is also in the block; and
- **downward closure**: if a node is in the block, then all its descendants are also in the block; and
- **parent closure**: if all children of a node are in the block, then this node is also in the block.
