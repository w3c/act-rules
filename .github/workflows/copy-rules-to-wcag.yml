# Commit a change to the ACT rules to the wcag repo, renaming it.
#
# Notes 
# - the ACT repo branch and file name need to be set in two places below
#  - in the on: trigger definition
#  - with the other configuration vars in env
# - A Personal Access Token (PAT) stores as a secret is required to push
#   - Suggest a specific W3C account it used for this rather a user account, so not accidently deleted
# - the git user name and useremail are provided and are shown in GitHub as who performed the commit.
# - GitHub shows a link in the commit message as link to the ACT repo commit so changes can be viewed
